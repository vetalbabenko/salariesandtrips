1. Set up a kafka in docker
    - pull docker image: git clone https://github.com/wurstmeister/kafka-docker.git
    - cd cloned project and replace docker-compose.yml with one which located in docker-compose: docker-compose-kafka.yml
    - run next command: docker-compose up -d
    - verify if everything is running: docker-compose ps
    - you should observer 2 process running: kafka and zookeper


2. Set up a kafka in docker
    - pull docker image: git clone https://github.com/m-semnani/bd-infra.git
    - cd cloned project and replace docker-compose.yml with one which located in docker-compose: docker-compose-hadoop.yml
    - run next command: docker-compose up -d
    - verify if everything is running: docker-compose ps
    - you should observer 2 process running
 
3. Next you need to download kafka sources, to be able to send messages to kafka:
    - download it from officia website and extract https://apache.ip-connect.vn.ua/kafka/2.6.0/kafka-2.6.0-src.tgz 
    - use next commands to send message: bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 172.17.0.1:9092 --topic user
    - there are to type of messages, plain one with data and `run-agg` to trigger aggregation:
    Example: 
      1,2,3
      2,5,10
      1,19,20
      2,20,14
      run-agg   

4. To verify if data save to hdfs, you also need hadoop binaries:
    - download it from officia website and extract https://apache.ip-connect.vn.ua/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.10.1/hadoop-2.10.1.tar.gz 
    - use next commands to verify: bin/hdfs dfs -ls "hdfs://172.17.0.1:9092"
